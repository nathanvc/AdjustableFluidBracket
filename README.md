* Bracket designed to install outside of a med associates behavior box

* Designed to hold 3 separate 10mL syringes in combination with the syringe holder

* Requires separate printing of 3 syringe brackets from this same repository

* Syringes used as fluid reservoirs can be moved up and down the bracket to control fluid flow

* Designed for use in combination with Multi Tastant spout

* Number labels allow tracking of syringe position each day (fluid flow can be different with different valves, weather, wear...)

* Prints in two pieces

* Upper piece installs with extension of grid above box

* Lower piece fits together with upper piece braced by brackets behind assembly

* This file generates both pieces and requires a large print bed will require alterationg to print on smaller printer

* It is helpful to hook grids together using syringe holders to make sure spacing is correct

* Printing with low resolution works fine

* Tested with 3mm ABS printed on a LulzBot Taz 4/5, 0.35 mm hexagon print head

* Designed to fit outside/above to hold fluid tubes that then enter box through right side opening in a Med Associates behavior box
